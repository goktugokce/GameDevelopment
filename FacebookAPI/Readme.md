*In this project, I will create an IOS Facebook API, I coded Twitter API for project 6 in androidstudio, now I want to get familiar with IOS and FacebookAPI
I tried to integrate "continue with facebook" option to a non-existed login page.
When you click to the button, it forwards you to the Facebook and asks your permission to use the app. If you decline, it displays an alert "Permission Denied"*
