**Game Project-4 Tic-Tac-Toe Android Game**

*In this project, I tried to create a game for androids, I am really new in Android Studio therefore, I tried to keep things simple, game is tic-tac-toe game. Game is multiplayer and one user puts 'X' and the other one 'O'. Who puts 3 'Xs' or 'Os' in vertical, horizontal or cross wins the game*
